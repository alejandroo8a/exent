# Exent

The aim of this application was to do an application to sell the event's tickets, something like Ticket Master. It was a project that wasn't developed completely 
but I've implemented good practice and architeture. What I used was:
* RxJava
* Kotlin
* Dagger
* Retrofit
* MVVM architecture
* Butterknife
* Mocked responses
